# Obsidian plugin - Google Save

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md), combining with Google Drive for syncing files

This plugin is based on another plugin, [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save), so please check that out first. At the moment of writing this, Remotely Save hasn't support Google Drive yet, so this plugin is for resolving that problem.

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

This plugin is still in beta-testing, so use it at your own risk.

## How to use

Since this plugin is still in beta testing, it's not available on obsidian community list yet. You can try this plugin by using another plugin called [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) to install this from github.

Upon installation, please go to the plugin settings for login to google, and grant the app permissions to access Google Drive.
